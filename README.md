 Networks Analysis

Hypothesis: Certain teams in Formula 1 racing overtake their temamates more than opponents.

I conducted network analysis to observe trends in overtaking between teams and drivers(Figure 1). The data used is a weighted and directional compilation of every overtake during the 2021 F1 season. Each of the ten teams consisted of two drivers making a total of twenty nodes. The 264 weighted edges in the network represent 844 instances of overtaking between the drivers and are directed to show which dirver overtakes another. The primary focus of the analysis was to observe overtaking within and between teams. 
A coeffecient of overtaking was derived by taking the sum of the weights of opponent overtakes and dividing that sum by the number of opponets overtaken. This average overtaking coeffecient was then compared to a similar calculation made between teammates. The results are diplayed in the histograph below(Figure 2). The teams are orderd in the histoprah based on their final standings in the 2021 F1 Constructors Competition with the highest scoring team on the left and the lowest scoring team on the right. Although the results are somewhat inconclusive, it is easy to see that teams that performerd poorly tended to have higher rates of temmate overtaking.
